# Java Basic Programming 
- Java 8 Primitive Data-types: A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword. Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. The range of values is calculated as −(2^(n−1)) to (2^(n−1))−1; where n is the number of bits required.
- byte: 8-bit, Range of values that can be stored: are from -128(min) to 127(max). The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays. byte = 103;
- short: 16-bit, Range of values can be stored are from −32768(min) to 32767(max). Also, using short data type to save memory in large arrays. short = 4323;
- int: 32-bit, Range of values can be stored are from -2^31(min) to 2^(31-(1))(max). We use int data type to define a 32-bit undefined integer. int = 4;
- long: 64-bit,Range of values that can be stored are from -2^63(min) to 2^(63-(1))(max). long data type to represent large integer values. long = 230,465,323L;
- float: A single-precision 32-bit floating point. Float data type represent, save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. float = 8.0f
- double: A double-precision 64-bit floating point. double = 4.0; Used for decimal values this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.
- boolean: Has only two possible values: true and false. This data type represents one bit of information. boolean = true/false;
- char: A single 16-bit Unicode character. char = 'A';
